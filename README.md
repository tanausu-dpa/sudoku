# Sudoku

A Sudoku solver. The code is much older than the first repository version.

Use:

 python sudoku.py file

where file is an ASCII file with the following format

The first line has the dimensions of the Sudoku board, first the big
squares and then the small squares, split by a comma ','.

Then, each line should correspond to each row of the Sudoku board,
splitting between columns with a comma ',', and leaving a space when
there is an empty square.

An 'example' file is in the repository.
